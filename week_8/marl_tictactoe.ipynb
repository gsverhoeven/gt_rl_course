    "In this notebook, we will take our first steps into the exciting world of **multi-agent reinforcement learning**. The simplest approach to multi-agent learning is to have the agents learn independently from each other, without having knowledge of each other. From the perspective of the learning agent, the other agents are simply part of the environment. (Literature: Littman 1994, Busoniu 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses [PettingZoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml), a Python library for conducting research in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It's akin to a multi-agent version of OpenAI's Gym library. \n",
    "\n",
    "PettingZoo has a large collection of environments (games) available, including Tic-Tac-Toe. We already experimented with Tic-Tac-Toe as part of the introduction chapter of Sutton and Barto. Tic-Tac-Toe therefore seems a natural starting point to start with multi-agent learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start with PettingZoo, we first need to learn about the concept behind the package, which is to model each game as **Agent Environment Cycle (AEC)** games.\n"

    "From [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13051) by Justin Terry et al:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The  base  component  of  an  AEC  game  is  a  **changeable  list of agents**.  After the first agent in the list acts, the environment can “act” (allowing agents’ observations to be updated), or the next designated agent can act (skipping environment turns are how truly simultaneous games are depicted). This process continues indefinitely.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">As  for  reward,  after  every  agent  takes  a  turn  a  “partial” reward is emitted to every other agent. The reward associated with a single action performed by an agent is the total of all the partial rewards following that action and before the agent’s next turn (until this point, the reward is not fully defined).   \n",
    "\n",
    ">Different aspects of a game will be responsible for different portions of reward. As shown in [this paper], thinking about rewards in this atomized manner instead of lumping the reward process all together can be very helpful."

    "## PettingZoo: interacting With Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments can be interacted with using a similar interface to Gym:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "env.reset()\n",
    "for agent in env.agent_iter():\n",
    "    observation, reward, done, info = env.last()\n",
    "    action = policy(observation, agent)\n",
    "    env.step(action)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The commonly used methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`agent_iter(max_iter=2**63)` returns an **iterator** that yields the current agent of the environment. It terminates when all agents in the environment are done or when `max_iter` (steps have been executed).\n",
    "\n",
    "`last(observe=True)` returns `observation`, `reward`, `done`, and `info` for the agent currently able to act. The returned reward is the **cumulative reward** that the agent has received since it last acted. If observe is set to `False`, the observation will not be computed, and `None` will be returned in its place. Note that a single agent being done does not imply the environment is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "observation, reward, done, info = env.last()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`reset()` resets the environment and sets it up for use when called the first time. Only after calling this function do objects like `agents` become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "`step(action)` takes and executes the action of the agent in the environment, automatically switches control to the next agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "While developing code, several lower level methods I found useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "`agent_selection` displays the currently selected agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "`agents` list all available agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete API including lower level functionality is at https://www.pettingzoo.ml/api\n",
