    "Here we will train a multi-agent game using single agent Q-learning. This means that from the perspective of each player, the other player is part of the environment. It follows that the learned strategy of the first player is tuned to the strategy used by the second player. The second player's strategy can be thought of forming a part of the environment the first player learns to perform optimally in.\n",

    "This is possible for Tic-Tac-Toe because no state is ever visited twice during a single game. However, this is not true for all games, so I think it is better to implement Q-learning in a more general way, where we learn each time the player \"steps\" through the game."
